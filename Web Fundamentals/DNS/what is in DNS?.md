# DNS (Domain Name System)
>DNS (Domain Name System) provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers

### 1. This is reason Why we use DNS
- Every computer on the internet has its own unique address to communicate with it called an IP address. 
- An IP address looks like the following 104.26.10.229, 4 sets of digits ranging from 0 - 255 separated by a period. 
- When you want to visit a website, it's not exactly convenient to remember this complicated set of numbers, and that's where DNS can help. 
- So instead of remembering 104.26.10.229, you can remember tryhackme.com instead.

### 2. Domain Hierarchy
##TLD
- A TLD is the most righthand part of a domain name. 
- gTLD\n
  Historically a gTLD was meant toÂ tell the user the domain name's purpose
